# Muhammad Azlan bin Adzmi

My objective and goal for this course was to gain knowledge in the field of computer and technology. The knowledge taught by the lecture was very useful. It's  helping me to understand more about the main concepts of the computer science course. The assigned project also helped me learn about how to apply design thinking to the project development process.

The project helped me to explain each level of design, decision making and problem solving, with a clearer understanding of how the work goes and how design thinking can be incorporated into development. I also learned about how good teamwork helps in solving problems and improved my skills in group management. With the knowledge gained during this project it allowed me to understand the course.

In conclusion, the knowledge and skills I gained are very meaningful and important in my study and career in this field. It will not only enhance my software engineering skills but also expand my knowledge and understanding of other important aspects of the information technology industry.
